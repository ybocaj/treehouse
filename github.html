    <h2>Setting up a GitHub account</h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you already have a GitHub account you do not need to create a new account to store and manage your Techdegree
    projects. You can simply click the "Sign In" button, enter your username and password, and then proceed to the
    Downloading and Installing the GitHub Desktop Application step below.</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Start by going to <a href="github.com">github.com</a> in your browser.</li>
    <li>You should see a form on the main page with a "Sign up for GitHub" button. Fill out that form and click the button. If
    you don’t see that form on the main page, you can also access it by clicking the "Sign Up" button located in the
    top-right corner of the page.</li>

    <li>Next you will need to choose your subscription plan. Select the Free option as it contains all of the features and tools
    you will need for your work in the Techdegree and click the "Continue" button.</li>

    <li>From there, you'll tailor your GitHub experience. You will be asked questions about your experience level and what you
    will be using your GitHub account for. Choose whichever options are most appropriate for you.</li>

    <p>Congratulations! You now have your very own GitHub account.</p>

Downloading and installing GitHub Desktop
Start by going to desktop.github.com in your browser.
Choose the appropriate option for your operating system (Windows or macOS) and click on the "Download" button. If you
are unsure of your operating system, the appropriate choice will typically be shown by default.


Open the downloaded file (by default the installer will be downloaded to your Downloads folder). Opening this file
should automatically install the Desktop application. The application should open once it is finished installing.
Click on the "Sign in to Github.com" option and enter the email address and password associated with your GitHub
account.
After signing in for the first time you should see a "Configure Git" screen where you will need to enter a name and
email address. This information will be used to identify any commits (i.e. changes) that you make to the projects that
you record with Git.
The final step is to choose whether or not you want to send usage data to Github. Either choice is fine for the purposes
of the Techdegree and won’t affect how you use the application going forward. Choose your preference and click the
"Finish" button.
Well done! You have successfully installed the GitHub Desktop application.

Desktop

Creating a GitHub repository for a new project
Open the GitHub Desktop application.
Select the "New Repository" option from the "File" menu in the upper left-hand corner of the page.
This will display a form. Fill out the form as follows:
Enter a name for your project.
Enter a brief description of the project.
Enter the local path (the parent directory/outermost folder) of your project.
Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" option.
Select "Node" from the Git Ignore dropdown if you are working with JavaScript. Otherwise, select the language option
most appropriate for your project.


Once you have filled out the form, click the "Create Repository" button.
Nice work! You have just created a new repository on your computer.

Project

Accessing files in an existing repository
Open the GitHub Desktop application.
Click on the "Current repository" tab, which should be at the top left of the application.
Select the repository you would like to access.


Find the section that reads "View the files of your repository in Explorer" and click on the "Show in Explorer" button.
This will open a folder showing the project files for your repo. Note: On a Mac, the word "Explorer" will be replaced by
"Finder".
Publishing a repository
Open the GitHub Desktop application.
Click on the "Current repository" tab, which should be at the top left of the application.
Select the repository you would like to work with.
Click on the "Publish repository" tab, which should be at the top right of the application.


A window will pop up with the repository name and description. Be sure to uncheck the box for "Keep this code private"
and then click the "Publish repository" button. Note: If you do not uncheck the "Keep this code private" box other
people will not be able to view your repository, even if you share the URL with them.
Congratulations! Your repository is now published on GitHub. You can now click on the "View on GitHub" button to open
your repository in the browser.

a GitHub Project

Updating a repository
Changes that you make to files in your local repository do not automatically get added to your GitHub repository. In
order for these changes to show up in your GitHub repository, they must be "committed".

Open the GitHub Desktop application.
Click on the "Current repository" tab, which should be at the top left of the application.
Select the repository you would like to update. Repositories that contain changes that have not been committed to GitHub
will be marked with a blue circle.
Once you select a repository, you will see a "Changes" tab on the left which shows a list of files that have been
changed since the last commit.


Check the box to the left of the files that you would like to commit. Note that a commit can be for a single file or
multiple files.
In the summary field, enter a brief but descriptive message like "added code comments" or "created printQuote function"
to summarize the changes that have been made since the last commit. You also have the option to include additional
details on these changes in the Description field but this is often left blank.
Click on the "Commit to main" button, which will record the changes to the main branch of your local repo.
Click on the "Push origin" tab. This will update, or "push", these changes to your GitHub repository.
Good job! You have added files and/or changes to your project, committed them to the local repository, and pushed them
to your GitHub repository.

It is a good habit to regularly make commits to your repositories as you build a project. It is also a good practice to
double-check that all of your commits have been pushed before you share a link to your GitHub repository or submit your
Techdegree project for review.

Creating a repository for an existing project
Open the GitHub Desktop application.
Select "New Repository" from the File menu, which will open the "Create a New Repository" window.


Fill out the form as follows:
Enter a Name for your project. Note: The name of this new repository must be exactly the same as the name of the
existing project folder.
Enter a brief Description of the project.
Enter the Local Path (the parent directory/outermost folder) of your project.
Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" option.
Select "Node" from the Git Ignore dropdown if you are working with JavaScript. Otherwise, select the language option
most appropriate for your project.
Once you have filled out the form, click the "Create Repository" button.
After you have created a repository for your existing project, you will then need to publish the repo using the
instructions in the Publishing a Repository Using the Desktop Application section of these instructions.
Bravo! You have created and published a repository for your existing project.

Final words
The GitHub Desktop application is a convenient and useful tool but it is best used as an entry point for working with
Git and GitHub. As you continue on your coding journey and start to become familiar with the command line, you should
consider transitioning away from the Desktop App and work on learning to create and manage your repositories using the
command line.
